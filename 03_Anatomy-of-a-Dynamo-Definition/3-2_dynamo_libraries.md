## 3.2 DYNAMO LIBRARY

The Library contains the Nodes we add to the Workspace to define visual programs for execution. In the Library, we can search for or browse to Nodes. The Nodes contained here - the basic Nodes installed, Custom Nodes we define, and Nodes from the Package Manager that we add to Dynamo - are organizaed hierachically by category. Let's review this organization and explore the key Nodes we will use frequently.
