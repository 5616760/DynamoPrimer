    <td colspan="2">Clockwork is a collection of custom nodes for the Dynamo visual programming environment. It contains many Revit-related nodes, but also lots of nodes for various other purposes such as list management, mathematical operations, string operations, unit conversions, geometric operations (mainly bounding boxes, meshes, planes, points, surfaces, UVs and vectors) and paneling. </td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">This library extends Dynamo/Revit functionality by enabling users to unfold surface and poly-surface geometry. The library allows users to first translate surfaces into planar tessellated topology, then unfold them using Protogeometry tools in Dynamo. This package also includes some experimental nodes as well as a few basic sample files. </td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Firefly is a collection of nodes which enable dynamo to talk to input/output devices, like the Arduino micro controller. Because the data flow happens “live”, Firefly opens up many opportunities for interactive prototyping between the digital and physical worlds through web cams, mobile phones, game controllers, sensors and more. </td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">The Dynamo Mesh Toolkit provides many useful tools for working with mesh geometry. The functionality of this package includes the ability to import meshes from external file formats, generate meshes from pre-existing Dynamo geometry objects, and manually build meshes through vertices and connectivity information. Additionally, this toolkit includes tools to modify and repair mesh geometry. </td>

    <td colspan="2">The Rhynamo node library provides users with the ability to read and write Rhino 3DM files from within Dynamo. Rhynamo translates Rhino geometry into usable Dynamo geometry by using McNeel’s OpenNURBS library allowing for new workflows that can exchange geometry and data fluidly between Rhino and Revit. This package also contains some experimental nodes that allow for “live” access to the Rhino command line. </td>
