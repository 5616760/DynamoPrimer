##2.3 The Workspace

The Dynamo **Workspace** is where we develop our graphs, but it's also where we preview any resulting geometry. Wether we are working in a Home Workspace or a Custom Node, we can navigate with our mouse or the buttons at top right. Toggling between modes at bottom right switches which preview we navigate.
