##2.3 The Workspace

The Dynamo **Workspace** is where we develop our graphs, but it's also where we preview any resulting geometry. Wether we are working in a Home Workspace or a Custom Node, we can navigate with our mouse or the buttons at top right. Toggling between modes at bottom right switches which preview we navigate. 

> Note: Nodes and geometry have a draw order so you may have objects rendered on top of each other. This can be confusing when adding multiple nodes in sequence as they may be rendered in the same position in the Workspace.

###2.3.1 Tabs
The active Workspace tab allows you to navigate and edit your graph. When you open a new file, by default you are opening a new **Home** Workspace. You may also open a new **Custom Node** Workspace from the File Menu or by the New Node by Selection right-click option when Nodes are selected.

> Note: You may have only one Home Workspace open at a time; however, you may have multiple Custom Node Workspaces open in additional tabs.
