### Node Names
You can call any regular node in the library through a Code Block as long as the node isn’t a special “UI” node: those with a special user interface feature. For instance, you can call Circle.ByCenterPointRadius, but it wouldn’t make much sense to call a Watch 3D node.

Regular nodes (most of your library), generally come in three types:

Create:	Create something

Action:	Perform an action on something

Query:	Get a property of something that already exists

You’ll find that your library is organized with these categories in mind. Methods, or nodes, of these three types are treated differently when invoked within a Code Block.

### Flexibility
With Code Blocks, a user has flexibility to decide how to specify inputs. Here are several different ways to make the point (10, 5, 0):

As you learn more of the available functions in the library, and you know what you want, you might even find that typing “Point.ByCoordinates” is faster than searching in the library and finding the proper node.
