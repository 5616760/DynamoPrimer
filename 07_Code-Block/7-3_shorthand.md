### Numbers, strings, and formulas
In addition to inputs and operators, code blocks are flexible towards data types.  The user can quickly define numbers, strings, and formulas and the code block will deliver.  In the image below, you can see the "old school" way of doing things is a little long-winded: the user searches for the intended node in the interface, adds the node to the canvas, and then inputs the data.  With code block, the user can double-click on the canvas to pull up the node, and type in the correct data type with basic syntax.

>The number, string, and formula nodes are three examples of Dynamo nodes which are arguably obsolete in comparison to the code block.

### Ranges
Similarly, the method for defining ranges and sequences can be reduced to basic shorthand.  Use the image below as a guide to the ".." syntax for defning a list of numerical data with Code Block. After getting the hang of this notation, creating numerical is a really efficient process:
