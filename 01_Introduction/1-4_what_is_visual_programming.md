### 1.2 What is Visual Programming?

Creative practice frequently involves establishing visual, systemic, or geometric relationships between the parts of a design. Furthermore the process of defining these relationships in the development of a design more times than not has a procedural workflow that gets us from concept to result. Perhaps without knowing it, we are working algorithmically - definiting a step-by-step set of operations that follow an input, processing, and output logic. Programming allows us to continue to work this way but by formalizing our algorithms.

###1.2.1 Algorithms in Hand
While offering some powerful opporutinites, the term **Algorithm** can carry some misconceptions with it. Algorithms can generate unexpected, wild, or cool things, but they are not magic. In fact, they are pretty plain in and of themselves. Let's use a tangible example like an origami crane. We start with a square piece of paper (input), follow a series of folding steps (processing operations), and result in a crane (output).

So where is the Algorithm? It is the abstract set of steps, which we can represent in a couple of ways - either textually or graphically.

**Textual Instructions:**
1. Start with a square piece of
paper, coloured side up. Fold in half and open. Then fold in half the other way.
2. Turn the paper over to the white side. Fold the paper in half, crease well and open, and then fold again in the other direction.
3. Using the creases you have made, Bring the top 3 corners of the model down to the bottom corner. Flatten model.
4. Fold top triangular flaps into the centre and unfold.
5. Fold top of model downwards, crease well and unfold.
6. Open the uppermost flap of the model, bringing it upwards and pressing the sides of the model inwards at the same time. Flatten down, creasing well.
7. Turn model over and repeat Steps 4-6 on the other side.
8. Fold top flaps into the center.
9. Repeat on other side.
10. Fold both ‘legs’ of model up, crease very well, then unfold.
11. Inside Reverse Fold the “legs” along the creases you just made.
12. Inside Reverse Fold one side to make a head, then fold down the wings.
13. You now have a crane.

**Graphical Instructions:**

###1.2.2	Programming Defined
Using either of these sets of instructions should result in a crane and if you followed along yourself, you've applied an algorithm. The only difference is the way in which we read the formalization of that set of instructions and that leads us to **Programming**. Programming, frequently shortened from *Computer Programming*, is the act of formalizing the processing of a series of operations into an executable program. If we turned the above instructions for a creating crane into a format our computer can read and execute, we are Programming. The key to and first hurdle we will find in Programming, is that we have to rely on some form of abstraction to communicate effectively with our computer. That takes the form of any number of Programming Languages, such as Javascript, Python, C. If we can write out a repeatable set of instructions, like for the origami crane, we only need to translate it for the computer. We are on our way to having the computer be able to make a crane or even a multitude of different cranes where each one is slightly different. This is the power of Programming - the comptuer will do exactly what we tell it to and won't stop (or get tired) until we say so.

####1.2.3	Visual Programming Defined
If you were drawn to the graphical instructions over the textual ones for folding the origami crane, then **Visual Programming** is definitely for you. The process is essentially the same and utilizes the same framework of formalization; however, we define the instructions and relationships of our program through a graphical (or "Visual") user interface. Instead of typing text bound by syntax, we connect pre-packaged nodes together. Here's a comparison of the same algorithm programmed in Python and in Dynamo:

The visual characteristic to programming in such a way frequently speaks to creative professionals and definitely lowers the barrier to entry. Dynamo falls in the Visual Programming paradigm, but as we will see later, we can still use textual programming in the application as well.
