### 4.2.2 Operators

Operators are a set of components that use
algebraic functions with two numeric input values, which result in one output
value (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).

You use the Math Operators to perform arithmetical
actions on a set of numbers. These can be found under Operators >Actions.
