#####Points
A point is a location in space. For this primer, our coordinate system is X,Y, and Z. A point has a value for X, a value for Y, and a value for Z.

#####Vectors
A vector is a geometric quantity describing Direction and Magnitude. Vectors are abstract; ie. they represent a quantity, not a geometrical element.

#####Planes
Planes are “Flat” and extend infinitely in two directions, defining a local coordinate system.

#####Nurbs
NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) are mathematical representations that can accurately model any shape from a simple 2D line, circle, arc, or box to the most complex 3D free-form organic surface or solid.  They are created with rational algorithms and are infinitely differentiable.
